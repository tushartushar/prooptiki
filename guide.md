Athens is a vibrant city with unlimited choices and contrasts to fall in love with. Here’s a list of the sights, places and activities that will make your Athenian experience unforgettable.

Take a look at the amazing video capturing Athens at night ["City of Athens - A Portrait of a Changing Metropolis"](https://vimeo.com/256590553) by Alexandros Maragos.

## History

* Ο Μαραθώνιος Δρόμος είναι αγώνας αντοχής δρόμου κάλυψης επίσημης απόστασης 42,195 χιλιομέτρων (26,219 μίλια), που περιλαμβάνεται στα σύγχρονα ολυμπιακά αθλήματα.

* One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek titan-god of the sun Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. More info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes

* Democracy was inherited to the world by ancient Greece and especially Athens where it was developed around the fifth century BC. The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy)

* Mathematics and specifically geometry were greatly advanced in ancient Greece. Among the most famous mathematicians are Pythagoras, Euclides and Thales.  [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics)

* The name of Athens, connected to the name of its patron goddess Athena, originates from an earlier Pre-Greek language.

* Athens was named according to the Greek mythology from competition that the goddess Athena had with Poseidon about who will become protector of the city. The myth says that Poseidon gave a spring with sea water whilst Athena offered an olive tree as she touched the ground of the sacred rock of the Acropolis. The people of Athens choose Athena as their protector and so the city was named after the goddess of wisdom. The myth is symbolic but the two Gods symbolising the strength of Athens as a city of wisdom and as a sea power. The first settlement of Athens 3000 BC was situated on the rock of Acropolis.

* One of the most commonly used gadgets these days, an alarm clock has its origin in ancient Greece. In due course of time and with the proper sophistication of technology, the alarm clock went through a number of changes from a mechanical alarm to the modern gadgets like cell phone, which come with inbuilt alarm. But the first of alarms used by ancient Greeks were nothing like today. They used to integrate mechanism to time the alarm which would sound off delicate water organs or pebbles into drums.

* The Greeks also are important for the contribution to sports. "Gymnasiums" and "stadiums" today--are names that both come from Greek.  There are lots of other echoes of the Greeks in our sports tradition of today. Some of the universal track and field events (e.g., the javelin and the discus) come out of Greek tradition.  Events like the Marathon and the Decathalon have Greek names, though they weren't specific Greek events. Perhaps the best example of Greek influence on our sports tradition: the Olympic games.

* The **2004 Summer Olympic Games**, officially known as the **Games of the XXVIII Olympiad** and commonly known as Athens 2004, was a premier international multi-sport event held in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004 with the motto Welcome Home. 10,625 athletes competed, some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries

* The marathon event was created for the modern Olympic Games held in Athens. The marathon is a commemoration of the run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides (also known as Philippides), who ran from Marathon to Athens to report the Athenians’ victory against the Persians in 490 B.C.

## Climate

Athens has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. The dominant feature of Athens' climate is alternation between prolonged hot and dry summers and mild to cool winters with moderate rainfall.[37] With an average of 416.8 millimetres (16.41 in) of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between the months of October and April. July and August are the driest months, where thunderstorms occur sparsely once or twice a month.

## Museums/Sightseeing

* [The Pnyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnyx) is a picturesque location under the Acropolis where many distinguished Greeks addressed the people. [Themistocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles), [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) and [Kolokotronis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoros_Kolokotronis) were some among them.

* Despite the fact that Greece was the center of Science and Art in the ancient world, Greeks had to fight many wars. Regardless of its causes or its tolls, every war is a matter of study. [Athens War Museum](http://warmuseum.gr/en) is a place where artifacts from every war fought by the Greeks are gathered. Some of them predate even the iron age.

* ο Αρχαιολογικό Μουσείο Αγρινίου στεγάζεται σε κτίριο που βρίσκεται νοτιοανατολικά του μεγάλου πάρκου της πόλης και κτίστηκε τη δεκαετία του ’60 με δωρεά των αδελφών παπαστράτου

* Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes is a medieval castle in the city of Rhodes, on the island of Rhodes in Greece. It is one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Greece. The site was previously a citadel of the Knights Hospitaller that functioned as a palace, headquarters and fortress. More info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Grand_Master_of_the_Knights_of_Rhodes

* The National Archaeological Museum is a must if you want to explore the educational part of Athens and Greek history.
[click to see location](https://goo.gl/maps/PqarnX2ounx)

* It's impossible to come to Athens and not visit the Acropolis. The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens)

* Your walk to Acropolis and the monument of Parthenon can ideally match with a visit to the Acropolis Museum. The Acropolis Museum is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis of Athens. The museum was built to house every artifact found on the rock and on the surrounding slopes, from the Greek Bronze Age to Roman and Byzantine Greece.
[Click to see more](http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/)

* Apart from Athens, if you are in Greece and you have decided to visit parts of the rest of the country as well, one of the most important and most visited Greek museums is the Delphi Archaeological Museum. This museum displays some of the most valuable ancient Greece's surviving treasures, like Heniokhos (also known as Charioteer of Delphi), the Sphinx of Naxos and many more. Delphi was considered to be the navel (or center) of the earth and should definitely be one of the top priority destinations of every visitor.

* Don't forget to visit the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.The Archaeological Museum of Delphi is one of the most important in Greece since it exhibits the history of the Delphic sanctuary, site of the most famous ancient Greek oracle. Its rich collections comprise primarily architectural sculpture and statues donated to the sanctuary reflecting its religious, political and artistic activities from its early years in the 8th century BC to its decline in Late Antiquity.[Click to see more] (http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=3404)

* Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center: If you want to rest and take a walk into Athens' most beautiful spots [SNFCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavros_Niarchos_Foundation_Cultural_Center) is your place. [Located in the bay of Phaliron](https://goo.gl/maps/fB6XJbZ5pwk), includes new facilities for the National Library of Greece and the National Opera, as well as the 210,000 m² Stavros Niarchos Park. For more info click [here](https://www.snfcc.org/?lang=en)

* Athens is famous for its spectacular sights, its picturesque neighbourhoods and its natural beauty, where it is still preserved. If you want to fit as much as you can in only one view, your best bet is to grab a beer and get asap to one of the many hills around the city. The options are practically countless, but some great alternatives would be the following:
	Philoppappos hill ( https://goo.gl/SAsGeW ) ,
	Strefi hill ( https://goo.gl/DbtWfi ) ,
	Mount Lycabettus ( https://goo.gl/pd9dMi ) ,
	Both sides of the Attiko Alsos ( https://goo.gl/fGnPo8 )

* Technopolis - Located within touching distance of Syntagma Square and the Monastiraki Flea Market, Technopolis is an event and art space within an old natural gas processing plant. It has sort of a MoMA PS1 vibe. The industrial museum is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors learn about the work conditions in the old plant and its experiential approach to its operations during the 19th century. Most Athenians, though, will simply tell you to check the venue's events calendar for any upcoming concerts, parties, DJ sets and exhibits.
<br/><img src="https://github.com/tushartushar/taksidiotis/blob/master/Photos/tp.jpg" width="220" height="200"><br/>

* Eloi 1 - In the basement of the historic building of the Athens University of Economics and Business in Patission Street lies a place of dream and wonder. Where grandmaster Sofos awaits to nurture the young students who frequently use the lab scrambling to finish their projects in Java, SQL and various other subjects. ATTENTION!! Heavy rain might cause the lab to be flooded with water so I wouldn't visit it if the skies are grey.

* **Benakis Museum** - Antonis Benakis, a politician's son born in Alexandria, Egypt, in the late 19th century, endowed what is perhaps the finest museum in Greece. Its three floors showcase impeccable treasures from the Bronze Age up to WWII. Especially gorgeous are the Byzantine icons and the extensive collection of Greek regional costumes, as well as complete sitting rooms from Macedonian mansions, intricately carved and painted. But Benakis had such a good eye that even the agricultural tools are splendid.

* For me the best place at the center of Athens is "Avli", which is located at Psirri, Athens. If you are lucky enough to find the tiny door, open it and you will feel like you've entered the square of a small island village with white walls and blue shutters. It's the place were locals go to eat Greek traditional plates, all homemade dishes, and drink raki, tsipouro, ouzo, beer and wine. Despite all the above mentioned, what I personally love the most is the ambience of the place, which makes you forget you are a stranger and someway unites you with other people.
Here you can take a look at the inside:

( https://www.facebook.com/Cine-Dexameni-127237247287870/ )

## Extreme sports

* If you're looking for an adrenaline rush the southern suburbs of Varkiza and Vouliagmeni offer lessons in many extreme sports such as: SUP, rowing , wind surf, surf, jet ski, sailing and many more.
[click to see location](https://www.google.gr/maps/place/Varkiza,+Vari+166+72/@37.8175485,23.7817378,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a19525c364b6ff:0x77264baecded7346!8m2!3d37.8175503!4d23.7992474?hl=el)

* If you are a hiking enthusiast, Mount Hymettus, culminating at 1026 kilometers, is located east of Athens, near the Zografou university campus. So skip the monument visits and get your dose of fresh air by climbing up the mountain and enjoying spectacular views of the city all the way to the sea. Make a day of it and try to reach Kaisariani Monastery, a Byzantine monastery dating back to 1100.

* Bungee Jumping: If you want to feel happiness through the absolute meaning of freedom, this is the place to go. The power of the ability to “fly” everywhere, will definitely rise your adrenaline levels. "Zulu Bungy" have made their personal need of generously sharing smiles to people so as to make their world more beautiful. The spot that has been chosen to set up the appropriate facilities is one of the most magnificent works in the world. The Isthmus is the main strategic point of the Greek area and one of the most important works in East Mediterranean. Its tunneling has been a significant issue since the ancient times  as the creation of the canal would solve a lot of problems and would facilitate the navigation and the trade.

## Graffiti

~ Top Places to See Street Art in Athens:

* Pireos - Right next to a busy street, try not to get run over by a car while admiring the panels of street art that line this area. If you’re feeling more adventurous, head to Leonidou and Keramikou Streets and pretty much anywhere in the surrounding area. Once super-sketch and now only mildly sketch, find a lot of great pieces here too.

* Gazi - Not just for nightlife anymore. Come here and around the Technopolis area (an industrial museum and cultural space) to get your fill of culture without all the tourists. Large, government-approved pieces may not be as exciting as undercover art, but everything here is still raw and beautiful.

## Kids-activities

* If you want to spend a creative day with your children, get them to the Attica Zoo Park. Make sure you pick up a map to guide you around the park as it is huge, housing more than 350 animal species of which half are on the endangered list. Kids will love it.
[For more details click here](http://www.atticapark.com/en/)

* The Children's Museum in Plaka, which operates in collaboration with the Municipality of Athens, is very popular with young visitors, who enjoy the exhibits and the possibility to develop their observation skills, learn more about the cultural heritage and understand everyday life through games. Children can play at the shops of the "Market", make their own biscuits at the "Kitchen", journey through time at the "Attic", learn about their body at the exhibit "How do I move?", experiment and play with water and much more. Children under six years love the playroom where they can play with building blocks and visitors of all ages appreciate the toyshop with original toys and handmade objects.

* Allou! Fun Park: The most famous theme park of Athens, located at Rentis. It offers plenty of activities for both kids and, why not, adults! Unfortunately, the only public means of transport that gets you there is bus. [click to see location](https://goo.gl/maps/GAZStSK2NeA2)

* If you want to have fun and at the same time educate your kids visit Hellenic Children’s Museum:This museum is dedicated to kids and helps them learn in a fun way about how the world functions. A couple of examples of things they can do is to create with building materials, learn about the concepts of supply and demand in the marketplace, or even experiment with food ingredients in the kitchen.[Just click here to learn more about this interesting museum] (https://www.kidslovegreece.com/en/culture/hellenic-childrens-museum/)

[click to see location](https://goo.gl/maps/9rzPaefnvvy)


* A great place to go shopping and combining it with a strall in one of the most beautiful places of Athens, is the Monastiraki flea market. You will find all sorts of shops just next to each other ( https://www.athensguide.com/monastiraki.html ). At the end of the main market road (Ifestou), you will surely want to keep on walking towards Thissio, a place with wonderful ancient sights on your one side and many restaurants and cafes on the other, while you are talking your walk on a paved road, making the time stop and creating an unrepeatable feeling. ( http://www.athensguide.com/thission/index.html )

## Urban Tourist Spots

* Pittaki Street, a poorly lit industrial alley near Monastiraki Square connecting Ermou Street to Psirri, was not a very popular one. Lined with warehouses and small businesses, the pedestrian street was mostly used as a urinal after dusk. But everything changed in 2012, when a non-profit organization called Imagine The City partnered up with creative design studio Beforelight to revamp the forgotten street. Their idea? Turn the dark alley into a promenade. They started by asking locals to donate lamps and shades, and the residents quickly obliged; pretty soon, chandeliers, Chinese paper lanterns, and lamp fixtures piled up and were weatherproofed, wired, and strung together, creating a bright, cozy canopy over the street.

* Anafiotika - Mimicking the Cycladic architecture, with its stark white cubic houses, flat roofs and colorful shutters and doors, Anafiotika is truly a little island in the Greek metropolis. Wander through the narrow streets of Anafiotika, admire the many bougainvillea-covered walls but don’t forget to snatch some shots of the Acropolis from a different perspective.

* Aeropagus Hill - If you need to take a rest after visiting the Acropolis, take a break at the Vrahakia, the rocky top of Aeropagus Hill, right across from the entrance of the sacred site. From there, you can admire the actual size of the city and simply relax.

* Lycabettus Hill - If you’re the sporty type, why not hike up the paths in Kolonaki? If not take a bus from Panepistimiou Street or the funicular from Aristippou Street. The end game is to enjoy the most amazing view of Athens at an altitude of 300 meters. The 19th century chapel of Saint George, surrounded by pine trees, dominates the top of the mount Lycabettus, while the open-air theater here hosts a number of performances and concerts every summer.
<br/><img src="https://github.com/tushartushar/taksidiotis/blob/master/lycabettus.jpg"><br/>

## Events

* Technopolis Jazz Festival - Organized by the Technopolis City of Athens and the Onassis Cultural Center, the Technopolis Jazz Festival is one of the best open-air concert experiences you can have in Athens before the summer. Each year, during the last week of May, multiple talented jazz musicians from Greece and all around the globe come together to celebrate Jazz Music and give you a performance you will never forget! The festival lasts 6 days and the entrance is free so Jazz Be There - pun intended.

* Epidaurus Festival - Ever wondered what theater was like in Ancient Greece? Then why not make the trip to Epidaurus to witness it with your own eyes, in the place where some of the most important figures of Ancient Greece's tragedy and comedy scene like Euripides, Aeschylus and Aristophanes enacted their plays. Epidaurus performances are presented every Friday and Saturday, from the beginning of July to mid-August. Starting hours: 21:00 for Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus, 21:30 for Little Theatre of Ancient Epidaurus.

## Other tips and tricks

* Man's best friend. This will make your day.
<br/><img src="https://github.com/tushartushar/taksidiotis/blob/master/Photos/image1.jpeg"><br/>


* Greece is a small country, so it is a good idea to travel almost all around the country and not only to one place, since you decided to travel all the way to the southern country of Europe.

* If a traveller wishes to visit most of Athens' regions, it is highly recommended to use the subway instead of buses. It covers a lot of areas and is actually cheaper that most of european underground transportation systems.

* There are many destinations close to Athens where you can make a daily trip, relaxing from the urban noise and air pollution. One of my favorite destinations is Nafplio, a 2-hours drive from Athens, where you can stroll in the peaceful and picturesque streets and also climb the Palamidi fortress and enjoy a breathtaking view! [For more details click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafplio)

* A day trip in Sounion (2 hours car drive from Athens) is a nice choice for somebody who wants to escape from the capital. The temple of Poseidon and the view from up there worth the visit. [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion)

* Don't forget your hat and your sunglasses!! Sunscreen is also a must (especially if you are fair-skinned)!

* Never bother lining up at the main entrance of the Acropolis. There’s a back way in that has a tiny line that no one knows about. This back door is faster and more efficient than the main like that every other tourist uses. By using this alternative entrance it will save you an hour of lining up in the blazing sun (should you ignore Vasilis’s tip above).

* Mobile Phone Data is important when you’ve stopped using paper maps. Outside the central subway stations you’ll find people set up selling sim cards with various data packs on offer. While they are looking to sell to locals – as a tourist it’s an absolute bargain for the mouth of data you get plus the ability to book bars and restaurants.

* The Greeks will be more friendly and eager to help if you try to speak some Greek, too. Just a couple of words are fine, they love it when they hear a stranger speaking their language. So, say “kalimera” instead of “good morning” and “efxaristo” instead of “thank you”, and you will see some big proud smiles in their faces.

* Adding to the previous tip a visitor can watch this 13 minutes video if he wants to learn something more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5cI_D1XA7M

* Rafting Ioannina: The famous Zagori, the famous Tzoumerka and wider region of Epirus are waiting to enchant you with the most beautiful rivers in Greece, virgin green forests, huge gorges, canyons and majestic mountains and endless rare natural beauties!
Equipment required for the activities of Rafting and Canoeing is provided (uniforms neoprene, life jackets, raincoats, helmets, paddles and neoprene shoes) to conduct a safe route. In every activity your experiences will be captured (photographs - video go-pro camera). Your stay in the region will be very pleasant and helpful, as are available numerous hotels and apartments that can meet your various needs in both areas of Zagori and Tzoumerka and the wider area of Ioannina.
